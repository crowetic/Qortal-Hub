# QortalLand Asset Catalog

This document is the living production inventory for reusable QortalLand assets. It is not a runtime manifest yet; it exists to track what should be generated, reviewed, approved, and eventually packed into the production asset pipeline.

Use this catalog together with:

- `docs/qortalland-asset-standard.md`
- `docs/qortalland-style-prompt.md`

Source PNGs should live under `src/assets/qortalland/source/` using the category folders defined in the Asset Standard.

## Catalog Rules

- Keep asset IDs stable once assigned.
- Use snake_case filenames.
- Treat approved benchmark assets as sizing references for related future assets.
- Keep gameplay behavior, interaction rules, and room placement data outside this catalog.
- Add new assets here before generating large batches so naming and scale intent stay consistent.

## Status Values

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| Planned | Asset is intended but not generated yet. |
| Draft | Asset exists but still needs scale, style, transparency, or placement review. |
| Review | Asset is being compared in-game against rooms and characters. |
| Approved | Asset is accepted as part of the reusable source library. |
| Deprecated | Asset should no longer be used for new rooms. |
