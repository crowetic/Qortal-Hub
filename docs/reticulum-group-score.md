# Reticulum Group Score

Group Score is a public-group discovery signal shown in Reticulum Q-Chat. It is an integer from 0 to 100 that combines four independent signals. Private groups deliberately receive no score: their activity and membership context should not be exposed through public discovery.

## Formula

```text
Group Score = QORT Holdings × 50% + Activity × 30% + Community × 10% + Legacy × 10%
```

The weighted result is rounded and clamped to 0–100.

### QORT Holdings — 50%

Holding is normalized against a target of 1,000,000 QORT:

```text
Holding Score = 100 × log(1 + balance) / log(1 + 1,000,000)
```

The score is capped at 100. A logarithmic curve was chosen instead of a linear one so a very large holder cannot flatten the useful differences between every other group. The 50% weight is an explicit product decision from the developer discussion.

### Activity — 30%

Activity combines three seven-day/recent participation signals. Each component scales proportionally to its target and is capped at 100:

```text
Activity Score =
  active authors over 7 days (target 50) × 50%
  + messages over 7 days (target 500) × 30%
  + messages over 24 hours (target 100) × 20%
```

One visible user post counts once. Active authors carry the most weight because participation breadth is harder to inflate than message volume; seven-day volume rewards sustained use; 24-hour volume adds recency without letting a short burst dominate. Activity contributes up to 30 points, making sustained participation the second-largest signal after QORT Holdings.

A successfully fetched activity directory that omits a public group is treated as zero activity. If the complete activity request fails, an existing valid snapshot is retained instead of replacing Activity with zeros.

### Community — 10%

Member count maps to ten tiers, then to the shared scale as `tier × 10`:

| Members | Tier / score |
| --- | --- |
| 0–10 | 1 / 10 |
| 11–25 | 2 / 20 |
| 26–50 | 3 / 30 |
| 51–99 | 4 / 40 |
| 100–249 | 5 / 50 |
| 250–499 | 6 / 60 |
| 500–999 | 7 / 70 |
| 1,000–2,499 | 8 / 80 |
| 2,500–4,999 | 9 / 90 |
| 5,000+ | 10 / 100 |

Community contributes at most 10 points to the total. A group reaches 9/10 Community points at 2,500 members and the full 10/10 at 5,000 members.

### Legacy — 10%

Legacy starts at zero and awards one total-score point for each completed year since the group was created. It caps at 10 points after ten completed years. This gives established groups modest recognition without preventing a new group from reaching 90/100 through QORT Holdings, Activity, and Community alone.

## Refresh and persistence

Q-Chat starts score discovery when Reticulum Q-Chat loads, not only when Find Groups opens. A snapshot is stored locally and shared by invitation previews, About Group, and discovery.

- Snapshots use six-hour slots based on Qortal network time, producing four scheduled refresh opportunities per day.
- Cached score data may be reused for up to 24 hours when a later fetch is unavailable.
- A newly encountered group can request an out-of-cycle refresh, with a five-minute cooldown.
- Real activity data may replace an assumed zero within the same slot.
- Holding data comes from `/groups/balances?limit=0&reverse=true`; Activity comes from the Reticulum public-group activity directory.

## Display and discovery

Score colors are consistent anywhere Group Score appears:

- 0–24: red
- 25–44: orange
- 45–64: yellow
- 65–94: green
- 95–100: Qortal blue

Find Groups uses deterministic tie-breakers so equal values do not jump unpredictably:

- **Top:** Group Score, Activity, members, newest.
- **Active:** Activity, active authors, seven-day posts, Group Score, members, newest.
- **Newest:** creation time, then group ID.
- **Largest:** members, Group Score, newest.

The implementation and constants live in `src/components/Group/reticulumGroupScore.ts`.
